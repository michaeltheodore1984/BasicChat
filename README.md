# BasicChat
Basic chat application written in Node.js and Socket.io

Sockets have traditionally been the solution around which most real-time chat systems are architected, providing a bi-directional communication channel between a client and a server. The server can push messages to clients. Whenever you write a chat message, the server will get it and push it to all connected clients.
